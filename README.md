1. CS 2400 Project 1 done by Hemil Bhavsar, Kevin Kim, and Sean Abi Saab.
2. Hemil did ~~~ . Kevin Kim added the union, intersection, and difference methods to the "BagInterface" interface for the ADT Bag. He then wrote client programs "ArrayBagTest.java" and “LinkedBagTest.java”. He also created a README.md file and completed the "efficiency.docx" that includes time complexities of every method in both the best case and the worst case for this assignment. Lastly, he helped the rest of his group project members implementing the union, intersection, and difference methods for both "ResizableArrayBag" and "LinkedBag" classes. Sean did ~~~ .
3. We have implemented a unit test class using some framework on "bagDriver.java" as our extra feature.
4. Here is the link to [our screencast video]() on YouTube.
